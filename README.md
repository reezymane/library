# library

Welcome to YOUR library!

This is a simple library app that allows a user to input book details and have those entries stored in a Javascript object and displayed on screen to see. The goal of this project was to put to use new skills with creating objects using object contructors, as well as gain more experience with html setup, DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS.

Try it out and store some books!
